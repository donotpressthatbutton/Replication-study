Replication study for RFA 

Dear Prof Van Lent, 

In this folder, you can find the following files:

1) Basu_start.dta 
   It is an dataset of combined data downloaded from    CRSP and Compustat. The two dataset are merged based on the firm identifier from the CRSP/Compustat Merged file. It is the start of replication study of Basu(1997). To re-run the regression, you could use the variable-generating code contained in the do-file.

2) Basu_final.dta
 It is the completed dataset contained all variables (downloaded and newly-generated variable based on downloaded ones) used in the analysis,except the estiamted coefficient used to draw Fig 1. You could rerun the regression by clicking the regression code in the do-file.

3) Basu.do
This do file contains all codes from merging different dataset to drawing graph in the robustness check. For parsimonious reasons,  I do not update the original data downloaded from WRDS. These original data are accessible upon requiry.

4)Fig3 Basu
It is the only figure contained in the replication result for your quick reference.

4) Basu1997.pdf
It is the replication report containing brief introduction of data, replication result and codes used. 

If you have any concern, please feel free to contact me.
